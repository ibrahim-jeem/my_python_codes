# This code will extract time from JFE time sheet and put them in the excell time sheet

import openpyxl as xl
from openpyxl import Workbook, load_workbook, worksheet
# from openpyxl.utils import get_column_latter
from xlutils.copy import copy


###Defining the excell workbook and worksheet as WB and WS
wb1 = xl.load_workbook('New Monthly Time Record - 2021.xlsx')
ws1 = wb1.active

###Creates a new worksheet
# ws2 = wb1.create_sheet('January 2022')

###Copying / Duplicate a worksheet
# ws2 = wb1.active		#Defining new worksheet
ws2 = wb1.copy_worksheet(ws1) #Coppying a active ws from wb

###Changing the value of a specific cell
ws2['A12'] = input()	#Give the value to change

###Removes a worksheet
# std = wb1.get_sheet_by_name('December - 2021 Copy')
# wb1.remove_sheet(wb1.get_sheet_by_name('December - 2021 Copy'))

###Calculating max row and column of the specific worksheet (WS1)
# mr = ws1.max_row
# mc = ws1.max_column

###Coppying the cell valuse using Loop function
# for i in range (1, mr+1):
# 	for j in range(1, mc+1):
# 		c = ws1.cell(row = i, column = j)

# 		ws2.cell(row = i, column = j).value = c.value

###Saving the file
wb1.save('New Monthly Time Record - 2021.xlsx')

###Seeing the values in a specific cell
# print(ws1['A12'].value)

print(wb1.sheetnames)
print(ws1)
